# Degenrate Games

This is a remake of a website for a company that no longer exists. From 2009 - 2011 during the beginning of the Apple AppStore Degenerate Games begain to make apps for the app store, it was unsuccessful. I will try to duplicate the original website the best that I can and improve what I can. This website is for demo purposes.

Dependencies:

* Astro 
* HTML
* Tailwind CSS
* Using opnform.com to create the contact form.

This is not complete there is still the resposiveness of the website that will need to be added.
